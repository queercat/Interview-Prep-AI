# Applying management methodologies to develop software.
# (Git, Scrum, Agile, Unit Testing)

# What is Agile...
"""
A software development methodology based on iterative development.

Requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between
self organizing cross functional teams.

Promotes frequent inspection and adaptation. All based off
of the 'Agile Manifesto'
"""

# What is Scrum...
"""
Scrum is a lightweight process subset of agile. 
The most widely used one.

* A "process framework"
	- Particular set of practices that must be followed.
	- Scrum uses sprints, XP requires paired programming.

* "Lightweight"
	- Overhead is small as possible to maximise productivity.

A scrum process is distinguished from others by specific
concepts and practices.

Three categories:
* Roles
* Artifacts
* Time Boxes 

Scrum most often used to manage complex software and
product development.

Significantly increases productivity and reduces
time to benefits relative to waterfall processes.

Scrum processes enable smooth transitions with
rapdily-changing requirements. 

Scrum benefits...
* Increase the quality of deliverables.
* Cope better with change.
* Provide better estimates with less time creating them.
* Be more in control of the project schedule and state.
"""

# Scrum Process Overview
"""
[Sprint Backlog -> Product Backlog] -> [Sprint]

Sprint Backlog: Features assigned to sprint.
Product Backlog: Features assigned by client.

Daily scrum meeting:
	- What has happened.
	- What will happen.
	- Issues.
"""

# Scrum Requirements...
"""
Scrum does not define specific requirements about
how they exist, just that they go into a PB as a PBI
(Product Backlog Item).

Most scrum projects borrow from the XP practice
describing a feature request as a 'User Story'. Although
some use an older concept called 'Use case'.
"""

# User Story (From XP [Extreme Programming])
"""
Describes a required feature in narrative form.
Usually written by the Product Owner and are the
Product owner's responsibility.
"""

# Story
"""
Not all stories need to be user-facing features.
Still represents work. 

Non-function requirements are "Technical Stores". Have
same elements as user stories but need not be cast 
into narrative form.

Typically written by team members then added to the PB.
The product owner is familiar with these in order to rank
implementation sequencing.
"""

# Defect
"""
A defect is a description of a failure of the product. 
Stored in a bug tracking system.

The product owner usually enters each defect into the PB.
"""

# Scrum Roles
"""
ScrumMaster or Scrum Master.

Keeper of the process, smooth integration of agile.

* Teach product owner to maximize ROI.
* Improve life of dev team.
* Improve productivity in any way possible.
* Improve product and notify team of progress.

Must maintain awareness of the process as a whole.
Acts as an interface between tasks and team.

Product Owner

Keeper of the requirements. "single source of truth"
regarding requirements, order of implementation.

In practice interface between business, customer,
product needs, and the team.

Maintains the product backlog. Sets the schedule and
makes the final call whether features are ready for release.

Team

The team is a self organizing group of people
who do hands on development and testing for the product.

Team must decide how to break work into tasks and how
to allocate tasks to individuals throughout sprint.

The team size should be kept in range from 5 - 9, larger
makes communication difficult while smaller leads to
less productivity.

Not to be confused with Scrum Team meaning ScrumMaster and PO.
