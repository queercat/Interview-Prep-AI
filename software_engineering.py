# Applying management methodologies to develop software.
# (Git, Scrum, Agile, Unit Testing)

# What is Agile...
"""
A software development methodology based on iterative development.

Requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between
self organizing cross functional teams.

Promotes frequent inspection and adaptation. All based off
of the 'Agile Manifesto'
"""

# What is Scrum...
"""
Scrum is a lightweight process subset of agile. 
The most widely used one.

* A "process framework"
	- Particular set of practices that must be followed.
	- Scrum uses sprints, XP requires paired programming.

* "Lightweight"
	- Overhead is small as possible to maximise productivity.

A scrum process is distinguished from others by specific
concepts and practices.

Three categories:
* Roles
* Artifacts
* Time Boxes 

Scrum most often used to manage complex software and
product development.

Significantly increases productivity and reduces
time to benefits relative to waterfall processes.

Scrum processes enable smooth transitions with
rapdily-changing requirements. 

Scrum benefits...
* Increase the quality of deliverables.
* Cope better with change.
* Provide better estimates with less time creating them.
* Be more in control of the project schedule and state.

# Scrum Process Overview
"""
[Sprint Backlog -> Product Backlog] -> [Sprint]

Sprint Backlog: Features assigned to sprint.
Product Backlog: Features assigned by client.

Daily scrum meeting:
	- What has happened.
	- What will happen.
	- Issues.
"""

# Scrum Requirements...
"""
Scrum does not define specific requirements about
how they exist, just that they go into a PB as a PBI
(Product Backlog Item).

Most scrum projects borrow from the XP practice
describing a feature request as a 'User Story'. Although
some use an older concept called 'Use case'.
"""

# User Story (From XP [Extreme Programming])
"""
Describes a required feature.
