# What is Unit Testing?

"""
Software tewting where individual units or components of a
software are tested. Validate each component performs as expected.

Unit testing is an active process during coding by 
developers.

A unit can be:
* Individual function
* Method
* Procedure
* Module
* Object

In SDLC, STLC, V Model, unit testing is first level
of testing before integration testing. Practically though
QA engineers also do unit testing.
